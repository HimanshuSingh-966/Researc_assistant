4. Note your project ID from watsonx.ai

### Step 4: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file (optional) or export environment variables:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=your-watsonx-project-id
export SPACE_ID=your-watsonx-space-id  # if using spaces instead of projects
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Research_Agent_NoteBook.ipynb
   ```

2. Run cells sequentially, entering your IBM Cloud API key when prompted

3. Use the interactive interface or test functions

### Option 2: Direct Python Execution

```python
from research_agent import create_research_agent, research_query

# Initialize agent
agent = create_research_agent()

# Make research queries
result = research_query("Find recent research on climate change mitigation")
print(result)
```

## üí° Using the Research Agent

```python
# Literature search
result = test_literature_search("machine learning in healthcare")

# Generate citations  
citation = test_citation_generation(
    "Smith, J. & Doe, A.", 
    "AI in Medical Diagnosis", 
    "2024", 
    "Journal of Medical AI", 
    "APA"
)

# Create hypotheses
hypotheses = test_hypothesis_generation(
    "Does social media usage affect student academic performance?"
)

# Draft paper sections
intro = test_section_drafting("Introduction", "renewable energy policy")
```

### Advanced Research Workflows

```python
# Run comprehensive literature review
report = run_research_workflow("artificial intelligence ethics", "literature_review")

# Generate research proposal
proposal = run_research_workflow("quantum computing applications", "research_proposal")

# Create systematic review
review = run_research_workflow("sustainable urban planning", "systematic_review")
```
